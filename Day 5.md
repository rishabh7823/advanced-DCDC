## ROUTE
### Routing

* It means to route two things

### Maze routing

*  Lee's algorithm (Lee 1961).

* We need to route this

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT

* Then create routing at back end

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT
  
* Then create two points

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT

* Then it does the numbering to reach the target

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT
 
* Then make the route

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT
  
* But it favours the least / single L

                                                                                                                                                                   -VSD-IAT 

### DRC Clean

* Whenever we build a wire, there should be a minimum distance between other wires


<img width="554" alt="r6" src="https://github.com/rishabh7823/advanced-DCDC/assets/164547532/a6747735-4835-4cd7-b0a5-5c057e00c841">
  
                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT
  
* 3 typical design rules for the above pair of wires will be:

The wire width should be a particular size (X)

The minmum pitch between two wires should be particular (X)

The minmum placing between the two wires should be particular (X)
  
* For example :

We have this picture as an example :

                                                                                                                                                                  -VSD-IAT  

* DRC Violation type signal short (Problem) 

Assume the metal layer to be Mn 

There will be a shield called Mn + 1

<img width="561" alt="r8" src="https://github.com/rishabh7823/advanced-DCDC/assets/164547532/1ff7518d-5bc9-4d1c-9f39-13e462caa815">
  
                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT

Now the problem is solved - there is no signal short

The second problem is that the metal should be connected to higher metal layer and lower metal layer, this is called Via width

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT

The third problem is that the space between the metal should be particular about size. This problem is called via spacing

                                                                                                                                                                   -VSD-IAT

## Routing using Tritan-Route
### Types of routing

*  Routing = Fast Route

*  Routing = Detailed Route


<img width="529" alt="r11" src="https://github.com/rishabh7823/advanced-DCDC/assets/164547532/6f5ea2bb-f9f7-4b91-aff8-43c4852a3044">

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT

### Steps to do and information, features

*  Performs inital detailed route

*  Honors the preprocessed route guides, attempts as much as possible to route within route guide

*  Assumes the route guides for each net satisfies the inter-guide connectivity

*  Works on preprocessed MILP-based panel routing scheme with intra-layer parallel and inter-layer sequential routing framework.

### Pre-processed route guides

  <img width="420" alt="r12" src="https://github.com/rishabh7823/advanced-DCDC/assets/164547532/848ebc3f-eb34-4151-8718-87f52ae7ade1">

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT

* Requirements of pre-processed guides :

* Should have unit width

* Should be in the pre preferred direction


### Inter-guide connectivity

* Two guides are connected if:

* They are on the same metal layer touching the edges

* They are on the neighbouring metal layers with a non-zero vertically overlapped area.

* Each unconnected terminal i.e. pin of a standard-cell instance should have its pin shape overlapped by a route guide 


### Intro-layer parallel inter-layer sequential panel routing.

                                                                                                                                                                    -VSD-IAT

## Tritan routing
### Problem statement

*  Input : LEF, DEF, Preprocessed route guide

*  Output: Detailed routing solution with optimized wire length and via count

*  Constraints: Route guide honoring, connectivity constraints and design routes.

                                                                                                                                                                  -VSD-IAT                                                                                                                                                                

* Access Point (AP) : An ongrid point on the metal layer of the route guide and is used to connect to lower-layer segment, upper layer segments , pino or 10 points

* Access Point Cluster (APC) : A union of all APS derived from the same lower-layer segment, upper-layer guide, a pin or a 10 point.



## Routing topology algorithm
### Algorithm 1.0 Optimization of routing topology

* For all i = 1 to n-1 do

* For all j = i+1 to n do

* cost(i.j) <- ( APC.i , APC.j)

* end for

* end for

* T <- MST(APC.s, COST.s)

* Return e(i.j) âˆˆ T

1-This is how the processor looks like

2-this is the board diagram of the proseccor
 
#### The details of the parts and the functioning of parts 

**connection of chip**

The chip is present at the middle and to connect the chip we  use something called as wire pounds.wire pounds help chip to connect with other parts. 


**important things inside the chip**

1-*PADS* 

PADS is somthing from which you can send the signals inside the chip 

2-*CORE* 

CORE is something where all our digital logic are placed 

3-*DIE* 

DIE is the size of the chip which is manufactured on the silicon 


**Woking inside the chip**

1.The tipical chip/core consist of RISCV SoC,SRAM,PILL,adc,adc1,dac,SPI
2.The SRAM ,PILL,adc,adc1,dac are called as foundry IP's

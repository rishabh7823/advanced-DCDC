#### The details of the parts and the functioning of parts 

_connection of chip_

The chip is present at the middle and to connect the chip we  use something called as wire pounds.wire pounds help chip to connect with other parts. 


_important things inside the chip_ 

-PADS 

PADS is somthing from which you can send the signals inside the chip 

-CORE 

CORE is something where all our digital logic are placed 

-DIE 

DIE is the size of the chip which is manufactured on the silicon
